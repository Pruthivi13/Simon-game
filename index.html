      <h2>Simon Game Rules</h2>
      1. Start of the Game: The game begins by displaying the first color in the
      sequence. For example, the game may show the color blue.<br />
      2. User Input:The player must click on the button that corresponds to the
      color shown (e.g., click on the blue button).<br />
      3. Sequence Progression: The game then shows the next color in the
      sequence. The player must remember the sequence and input it correctly.
      For instance, if the sequence is now blue, red, the player must first
      click on the blue button and then the red button.<br />
      4. Increasing Difficulty: After each successful input of the current
      sequence, the game adds an additional color to the end of the sequence.
      The player must remember and repeat the entire sequence each time, which
      grows progressively longer.<br />
      5. Game Over Condition: If the player clicks the buttons in the wrong
      order or selects an incorrect color, the game ends. <br />
      6. Objective: The objective is to correctly remember and input the growing
      sequence of colors for as long as possible. <br />
      7. Restart: After a game over, the player can start a new game, which will
      begin again with a single color.<br />
